# Brain-Tumors-Classification-CNN-
This dataset is a combination of the following three datasets :

figshare

SARTAJ dataset

Br35H

This dataset contains 7023 images of human brain MRI images which are classified into 4 classes: glioma - meningioma - no tumor and pituitary.

no tumor class images were taken from the Br35H dataset.

I think SARTAJ dataset has a problem that the glioma class images are not categorized correctly, I realized this from the results of other people's work as well as the different models I trained, which is why I deleted the images in this folder and used the images on the figshare site instead
